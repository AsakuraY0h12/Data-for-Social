However, different modifications of this dataset could provide usuful insights. The columns of this dataset are `Borough`,\t`Sex`,\t`Race/Ethnicity` and `Population`.

For the purpose of this analysis we are going to need the `Diversion Rate-Total (Total Recycling / Total Waste)` for each month from 2016-2020 which is the dependent variable we want to predict. In order to derieve that information we need to understand how the dataset is organized. First of all, the observations are using a different calendar. The Fiscal  year start from July 1st and ends in June 30th. So, in order to convert it in regular form we need to substrack one(-1) from the column fiscal year each time the respective month is July-December. Another thing that needed attention were the names of the `Zones`. All the specific zones were modified into their respective borough in oredr to be align with the other datasets(Tonnage Dataset) for the creation of the Merged Dataset i.e(Brooklyn North -> Brooklyn). Finally the dataframe was orginized by `Borough`,`YEAR` and `MONTH`.  \n",

We can assume that these months include  holidays so the amount of garbage is bigger than normal. \n"

        "\n",
        "The overall goal of this analysis has been achieved we have an prediction model which is accurate with a score of 0.8, some area that could have been improved it would have been more accurate if we had the raw data for the **Recycling_Diversion_and_Capture_Rates** as if we had the figures which lead to the diversion rate our model would be trained on data which is more representative of the reality. or similarly if we had the diversion rates for the **DSNY_Monthly_Tonnage_Data** rather than having to combine the two separate datasets which lead to some of the data being omitted due to dates. However both these data were obtained by the NYC Department of Sanitation therefore the data originates from the same source and is still considered valid \n",
        "\n",
        "As we aggregated the data by borough we would have generalised the outcomes as data in New York would be observed by neighbourhoods. As the city is densely populated the rates of our the dependant variables can contrast greatly from neighbourhoods within the same borough. Just as property prices do. This originates from underlying socio economic factors how the wealth is distributed within the different boroughs. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is also interesting to note that We set the threshold of significance to 3% so  p-statistic should be less that 0.03. Thus, we decided to subtract the columns `random` and `LEAVESORGANICTONS` and retrain the model, which improved Accuracy the model. However, when we removed `RESORGANICSTONS` this caused the model to score to slightly decrease hence why we left it in however the `RESORGANICSTONS` but this increase maybe due to slight overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Had we had more data we can use the model to predict for specific insights such as seasonal behaviour of recycling and refuse tonnage for instance around the holiday season. with these insights proactive steps and initiatives can be taken to maintain high levels of diversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The insights from the analysis can be used to better optimise where recycling facilities are set up. For instance the folium map of facilities can be used to produce a poll and gather data on where and what type of facility new yorkers would like to see available in their neighbourhoods to produce better cohesion between the citizens of New York and City governmental agencies agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps moving the focus should be spent more on gradually changing the habits and practices of new yorkers and soliciting the help of the UN to calculate some science based targets as opposed to a generic set goal of 2030 with initiatives being rolled out and amended as you go, this causes for a less streamlined focus."
